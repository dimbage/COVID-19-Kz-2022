**Abstract**
**Background:** Sputnik-V (Gam-COVID-Vac) is a heterologous, recombinant adenoviral (rAdv) vector-based, COVID-19 vaccine now used in >70 countries, yet there is a shortage of data on this vaccine's performance in diverse populations. Here, we did a prospective cohort study to assess the reactogenicity and immunologic outcomes of Sputnik-V vaccination in a multi-ethnic cohort from Kazakhstan.
**Methods:** COVID-19-free participants (n=82 at baseline) were followed at Day 21 after Sputnik-V Dose 1’ (rAd5) and Dose 2’ (rAd26). Self-reported local and systemic adverse events were captured using questionnaires. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to perform SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and immunologic assays.  
**Results:** Of the 73 and 70 participants retained post-Dose 1’ and 2’, respectively, most (>50%) reported an injection site or a systemic reaction to vaccination; no serious conditions were reported. Dose 1' appeared to be more reactogenic than Dose 2’, with fatigue and headache more frequent in participants with prior COVID-19 exposure; after Dose 2' nausea was more common in subjects without prior COVID-19. The combined S-IgG and S-IgA seroconversion rate was 97% post-Dose 1', remaining the same post-Dose 2'. The detectable virus neutralization rate was 83% post-Dose 1', further increasing to 98% post-Dose 2', with the largest increase seen in participants without prior COVID-19 exposure. Nasal S-IgG and S-IgA increased post- Dose 1', while the boosting effect of Dose 2’ on mucosal S-IgG, but not S-IgA, was only seen in subjects without prior COVID-19. Systemically, vaccination reduced growth regulated oncogene (GRO) levels, which correlated with blood platelet count elevation. 
**Conclusion:** Sputnik-V Dose 1' elicited both blood and mucosal SARS-CoV-2 immunity, while the immune boosting effect of Dose 2' was minimal, suggesting that adjustments to the current prime-boost vaccination regimen may be necessary to optimize immunization efficacy. Although Sputnik-V appears to have a reactogenicity profile similar to that of other COVID-19 vaccines, the observed alterations to the GRO/platelet axis call for further investigation of Sputnik V effects on systemic immunology.
